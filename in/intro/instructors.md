# Instructors

Hello, team! A few important links and ideas here - all public for the sake of transparency and more importantly: simplicity ðŸ˜€

## ðŸ‘‰ [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invyjyDY3FREI0V7s&inviteToken=77a8c4b974b0a587ee78402b150aeb7f13cc931295fd51a8f26736e641f06efb) ðŸ‘ˆ

This is the invitation to our WPP class base. This link is _only_ available to folks with **generalassemb.ly** email addresses. There will be several bases here that help us manage various parts of classroom tasks. If you haven't done so yet, **please sign up ASAP**

## Attendance

Attendance is super important! Here is how attendance works:

1. Every lecture, I will share a verbal "token" with the class. These tokens are themed - for this course, I have chosen to use colors.
2. Students will fill out this **[link](https://airtable.com/shroqAUHnqBINgrtm)**, also shared on student facing class homepage, to "check in" to class
3. I materialize several views to help us more easily catalog and take attendance.

**[Full Base Access (read only)](https://airtable.com/tblgBnxolWeYulUTj/viwNJodJ60xe5ibnc?blocks=hide)** | **[Filterable "Public" View](https://airtable.com/shrrjCgiJ0eVQB4GM)**

## [Homework](https://airtable.com/tblIPolX9annjawIy/viwfXp1iUeGDU7Ncr)

This is the Airtable base necessary for you to manage homework submissions. If you click on the "Views" dropdown, you will see views the correspond to each homework submission + a view for "late" submissions.

This is the Airtable base necessary for you to manage final project submissions. Note there are two tabs here - first tab manages proposals and the second tab links to proposals and manages submissions.
